Express Framework - Middleware
	37	What is middleware in Express.js and when to use them?

	Middleware are functions that run between the request and the response in Express.
	They can modify requests, responses, or execute additional code before sending a final response.

	Use middleware when you need to:
	Log requests
	Authenticate users
	Parse JSON or form data
	Handle errors
	Add headers or modify responses

	38	How to implement middleware in Express?

	Middleware are just functions that take (req, res, next) as parameters.

	39	What is the purpose of the app.use function in Express?

	app.use() is used to mount middleware in an Express app.
	You can use it for:
	Global middleware (runs for all routes)
	Specific route middleware (runs only for selected routes)

	40	What is the purpose of the next parameter in Express.js?

	The next parameter tells Express to move to the next middleware or route handler in the chain.
	If you don’t call next(), the request will hang and never reach the route.

	41	How to use middleware globally for a specific route?

	“app.use() → global, app.get() → route-specific.”	
	
	42	What is the request pipeline in Express?

	The request pipeline is the sequence of middleware and route handlers that an incoming
	request passes through before generating a response.
