REST API - HTTP Methods and Status Codes
	72	What are HTTP verbs and HTTP methods?

	HTTP verbs (or methods) define the action a client wants to perform on a resource.
	Common verbs include GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE.
	They represent operations like read, create, update, and delete.
	They are the backbone of RESTful API communication.

	73	What are the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE HTTP methods?

	GET: Retrieve data from the server (read-only).
	POST: Send data to create a new resource.
	PUT: Update or replace an existing resource.
	DELETE: Remove a resource from the server.

	74	What is the difference between the PUT and PATCH methods?

	PUT replaces the entire resource with new data.
	PATCH updates only specific fields of a resource.
	Example: PUT sends full user data; PATCH updates just the email.
	PUT is complete replacement, PATCH is partial update.

	75	Explain the concept of idempotent in RESTful API.

	An idempotent operation gives the same result no matter how many times itâ€™s repeated.
	Example: calling DELETE /user/1 multiple times still results in the same state (user removed).
	Methods like GET, PUT, and DELETE are idempotent.
	This ensures reliability and consistency in APIs.

	76	What is the role of status codes in RESTful APIs?

	Status codes show the result of an HTTP request.
	They help the client understand success, failure, or errors.
	Examples: 200 OK, 201 Created, 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found, 500 Server Error.
	They make debugging and client-server communication clear.
